## The Document Overload Crisis

**Modern professionals are drowning in PDFs**

Knowledge workers spend an average of **8 hours per week** searching for information buried in documents. Legal teams scroll through 200-page contracts hunting for specific clauses. Executives skim 50-page quarterly reports looking for revenue trends. Researchers wade through dozens of academic papers trying to find relevant methodologies.

The cost? **Missed insights. Delayed decisions. Wasted time.**

What if you could simply ask your documents questions—and get instant, accurate answers with exact citations?
